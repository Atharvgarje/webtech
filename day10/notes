it is a small code snippets/statements

     &nbsp;-> (non breakable space) for getting single space

semantic tags

    those tags by listening its name we get and idea for which purpose it is made for
    ex. header,button,footer,aside,from,list,ol,ul,caption,img,video,audio;
    symantic tags improve the code readability
